This is a draft document and may be updated, replaced or   obsoleted by other documents at any time. It is inappropriate to cite   this document as other than work in progress.</strong>
      </p>
      <p>This is an early draft of a document that will become a First Public Working Draft (FPWD) of the WCAG Extension on Mobile Accessibility. This document catalogs Mobile A11y Task Force proposed new mobile guidelines, success criteria and techniques. </p>
      <p>This document is intended to become a normative extension of <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20/">Web Content Accessibility Guideline (WCAG 2.0)</a> [[WCAG20]] and is part of a series of technical and educational documents published by the <a href="http://www.w3.org/WAI/">W3C Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI)</a>. </p>

      <h2 id="intro">Introduction</h2>
      <p>The Mobile Accessibility Extension to WCAG 2.0 provides guidance to improve accessibility for people with disabilities. While it generally applies to traditional mobile devices, it also applies to touch-enabled desktop devices, kiosks, tablets and other platforms that use technology beyond the traditional mouse and keyboard. While it is primarily oriented toward web content, the guidelines and success criteria also apply to mobile applications. </p>
      <h3>Structure of this Document</h3>
      <p>This version of the Mobile Accessibility Extension to WCAG is closely tied with WCAG. The early work of the group focused on writing Techniques for WCAG that applied to mobile. To make it easier to understand the relationship between these mobile Techniques and WCAG, a bare outline of the WCAG success criteria are included, with the appropriate Mobile Techniques listed below the success criterion. Many WCAG success criteria do not have mobile Techniques. Techniques that are proposed but not written are marked as<strong> [Mobile]</strong>. Completed or in process mobile Techniques are numbered starting with the letter &quot;<strong>M</strong>&quot;. </p>
      <p>New guidelines and success criteria that are not in WCAG 2.0 at the time of publication are marked as <strong>[MOBILE]</strong>. WCAG Guidelines and success criteria are prefixed with <strong>WCAG</strong>. </p>

    <h4>Intent of Guideline 2.5</h4>
    <p><span class="proposed">[Proposed text for Understanding] </span>Some devices such as a mobile device are designed to be primarily operated via gestures made on a touchscreen.  </p>
    <p>
Mobile device design has evolved away from built-in physical keyboards (e.g. fixed, slide-out) towards devices that maximize touchscreen area and display an on-screen keyboard only when the user has selected a user interface control that accepts text input (e.g. a textbox). </p>

    <h4 id="sc-touch-with-AT" class="sc"><span class="proposed">[Proposed New MOBILE Success Criteria] </span>2.5.1 Touch: All functions available by touch are still available by touch after platform assistive technology that remaps touch gestures is turned on.  (Level A)</h4>
    <section class="understanding">
      <h5><span class="proposed">[Proposed text for Understanding] </span> Intent of this Success Criterion</h5>
      <p>The intent of this Success Criterion is to ensure that content can be operated using gestures on a touch screen with platform assistive technology.  
Some assistive technology such as a screen reader will change the gestures that are used to interact with content when it is turned on.   For example, on both iOS and Android platforms a single tap on the touch screen will activate the element that currently has focus.  When the system screen reader is turned on, a single tap will move focus to that element and a double tap will activate the element.
All functions available by touch when the platform assistive technology is not turn on must be still available when the platform assistive technology is turned on.</p>
      <p>Be famililar with your platform's system controls and standards for assistive technology. Use the system controls supported by the platform first and don't overwrite the standard gestures of the platform. Don't use a common gesture for a purpose that is not common. </p>
      <h5>Specific Benefits of Success Criterion 2.5.1</h5>
      <ul>
        <li>People who are blind who rely on the use of a screen reader while interacting with the touch screen</li>    
        <li>People  	with low vision who may also need speech turned on while interacting  	with the touch screen</li>
      </ul>
   <h5>Examples of Success Criterion 2.5.1</h5>
   	  <ul>
         <li>If a developer assigns a double tap as a custom gesture, as the only way to complete an action, a user who is blind using VoiceOver will not have access to that action because VoiceOver reserves the double tap to select an item. </li>
         <li>If a developer assigns a swipe right as the only way to open a menu, the VoiceOver user will not be able to do that action, because VoiceOver takes over the right swipe as a way to move from element to element. To avoid this problem, the developer could ensure there is a mobile menu button that works with touch as another way to bring up the menu.</li>

    <h4 id="swipe-trap"><span class="proposed">[Proposed New MOBILE Success Criteria] </span> 2.5.2  No Touch Trap: When touch input behavior is modified by platform assistive technology and focus can be moved to a component, then focus can be moved away from component using sequential navigation gestures of assistive technology or the user is advised of the method for moving focus away in the sequential focus order. (Level A) </h4>
<section class="understanding">
<h5 class="intent"><span class="proposed">[Proposed text for Understanding] </span> Intent of this Success Criterion</h5>
<p>Swipe gestures are useful for displaying dynamic content. Giving focus to dynamic content via a swipe gesture also needs a gesture or method to move focus back to  prior content &mdash; either by swiping to return or by informing the user of the method needed to return. These methods must work with assistive technology. Explore by touch is not a valid solution, because the user can then miss content without knowing it was missed. This success criterion is similar to WCAG 2.1.2 No Keyboard Trap, however, it expands to all sequential navigation methods and compensates for touch specific failure criteria.  Relying on touch-to-explore features of mobile ATs to escape such a trap is still a failure under this criteria, because the next sequential item may be offscreen, an explore by touch gesture may cause users to get lost on the page, or the user may be relying on other means of sequential navigation such as a keyboard or switch control.</p>

<p>While using single letter keys as controls might be appropriate and efficient for keyboard users, single key shortcuts are disastrous for speech users, who can inadvertently set off multiple controls by speaking a single phrase.

    <h2>Abstract</h2>
      <p>
        The Mobile Accessibility Extension to WCAG 2.0 provides new guidelines, success criteria, and mobile Techniques that are an addition to Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.0. This extension does not replace WCAG 2.0. </p>

    <h2>Status</h2>

This is a draft document and may be updated, replaced or   obsoleted by other documents at any time. It is inappropriate to cite   this document as other than work in progress.</strong>
      </p>
      <p>This is an early draft of a document that will become a First Public Working Draft (FPWD) of the WCAG Extension on Mobile Accessibility. This document catalogs Mobile A11y Task Force proposed new mobile guidelines, success criteria and techniques. </p>
      <p>This document is intended to become a normative extension of <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20/">Web Content Accessibility Guideline (WCAG 2.0)</a> and is part of a series of technical and educational documents published by the <a href="http://www.w3.org/WAI/">W3C Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI)</a>. </p>

    <h4>Intent of Guideline 2.5</h4>
    <p><span class="proposed">[Proposed text for Understanding] </span>Some devices such as a mobile device are designed to be primarily operated via gestures made on a touchscreen.  </p>
    <p>
Mobile device design has evolved away from built-in physical keyboards (e.g. fixed, slide-out) towards devices that maximize touchscreen area and display an on-screen keyboard only when the user has selected a user interface control that accepts text input (e.g. a textbox). </p>

    <section class="understanding">
      <p><span class="proposed">[Proposed text for Understanding] </span></p>
      <h5>Intent of this Success Criterion</h5>
      <p>The intent of this Success Criterion is to ensure that content can be operated using gestures on a touch screen with system assistive technology.  
Some assistive technology such as a screen reader will change the gestures that are used to interact with content when it is turned on.   For example, on both iOS and Android platforms a single tap on the touch screen will activate the element that currently has focus.  When the system screen reader is turned on, a single tap will move focus to that element and a double tap will activate the element.
All functions available by touch when the system assistive technology is not turn on must be still available when the system assistive technology is turned on.</p>
      <p>Be famililar with your platform's system controls and standards for assistive technology. Use the system controls supported by the platform first and don't overwrite the standard gestures of the platform. Don't use a common gesture for a purpose that is not common. </p>
      <h5>Specific Benefits of Success Criterion 2.5.1</h5>
      <ul>
        <li>People who are blind who rely on the use of a screen reader while interacting with the touch screen</li>    
        <li>People  	with low vision who may also need speech turned on while interacting  	with the touch screen</li>
      </ul>
   <h5>Examples of Success Criterion 2.5.1</h5>
   	  <ul>
         <li>If a developer assigns a double tap as a custom gesture, as the only way to complete an action, a user who is blind using VoiceOver will not have access to that action because VoiceOver reserves the double tap to select an item. </li>
         <li>If a developer assigns a swipe right as the only way to open a menu, the VoiceOver user will not be able to do that action, because VoiceOver takes over the right swipe as a way to move from element to element. To avoid this problem, the developer could ensure there is a mobile menu button that works with touch as another way to bring up the menu.</li>

    <li><strong>Mxxx Multiple Elements: </strong>When multiple   elements perform the same action or go to the same destination (e.g.   link icon with link text), these should be contained within the same   actionable element. This increases the touch target size for all users   and benefits people with dexterity impairments. It also reduces the   number of redundant focus targets, which benefits people using screen   readers and keyboard/switch control.</li>

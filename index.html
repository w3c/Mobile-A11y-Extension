      </p>
      <p>This is a draft of a document that will become a First Public Working Draft (FPWD) of the WCAG Extension on Mobile Accessibility. This document catalogs new mobile guidelines, success criteria and techniques proposed by the Mobile A11y Task Force of the WCAG Working Group. . </p>
      <p>This document is intended to become a normative extension of <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20/">Web Content Accessibility Guideline (WCAG 2.0)</a> [[WCAG20]] and is part of a series of technical and educational documents published by the <a href="http://www.w3.org/WAI/">W3C Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI)</a>. </p>

      <h2 id="intro">Introduction</h2>
      <p>The Mobile Accessibility Extension to WCAG 2.0 provides guidance to improve accessibility for people with disabilities. While it generally applies to traditional mobile devices, it also applies to touch-enabled desktop devices, kiosks, tablets and other platforms that use technology beyond the traditional mouse and keyboard. While it is primarily oriented toward web and hybrid content, the guidelines and success criteria may also apply to native mobile applications. </p>
      <h3>Structure of this Document</h3>
      <p>This version of the Mobile Accessibility Extension to WCAG is closely tied with WCAG. The early work of the task force focused on writing Techniques for WCAG that applied to mobile. Many existing WCAG techniques apply to mobile in current form and are listed in the Appendix of the W3C Working Group Note: <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/mobile-accessibility-mapping/#wcag-techniques-that-apply-to-mobile">Mobile Accessibility: How WCAG 2.0 and Other W3C/WAI Guidelines Apply to Mobile</a>. The task force has written new Techniques for <strong>existing</strong> WCAG success criteria that specifically apply to mobile devices.  To make it easier to understand the relationship between these new mobile Techniques and WCAG, a bare outline of the WCAG success criteria is included, with the appropriate Mobile Techniques listed below the success criterion. Techniques that are proposed but not written are marked as<strong> [Mobile]</strong>. Completed or in process mobile Techniques are numbered starting with the letter &quot;<strong>M</strong>&quot;. </p>
      <p>New guidelines and success criteria that are not in WCAG 2.0 at the time of publication are marked as <strong>[MOBILE]</strong>. WCAG Guidelines and success criteria are prefixed with <strong>WCAG</strong>. </p>

    <h3 id="touch-and-pointer"> <span class="proposed">[Proposed New MOBILE Guideline] </span>Guideline 2.5: Touch and Pointer: Make it easier for users to operate touch and pointer functionality. </h3>
    <section class="understanding introductory">
    <h4>Intent of Guideline 2.5</h4>
    <p><span class="proposed">[Proposed text for Understanding] </span>Platforms today can be operated through a number of different devices including touch, stylus, pen, in addition to mouse and keyboard. Some platforms such as a mobile device are designed to be primarily operated via gestures made on a touchscreen.  Other devices can be operated by a number of different devices, such as a pen, stylus, or mouse, which may be generically referred to as <a href="#def-pointer-input">pointer inputs</a>. This section also applies to pointer events on non-mobile platforms.</p>
    <p>
Mobile device design has evolved away from built-in physical keyboards (e.g. fixed, slide-out) towards devices that maximize touchscreen area and display an on-screen keyboard only when the user has selected a user interface control that accepts text input (e.g. a textbox). Pointer devices such as stylus, pen or pencil have also gained popularity for providing more precise touch. The mouse has been popular on desktop computers for decades.    </p>
    <p> Although the definition of &quot;pointer inputs&quot; includes touch, we include touch and pointer for clarity.  When we use the term touch, we just mean touch. </p>
    </section>
    <section class="sc">
    <h4 id="sc-touch-with-AT" class="sc"><span class="proposed">[Proposed New MOBILE Success Criteria]</span>  Touch with Assistive Technology: All functions available by touch are still available by touch after platform assistive technology that remaps touch gestures is turned on.  (Level A)</h4>
    <section class="understanding">
      <h5><span class="proposed">[Proposed text for Understanding] </span> Intent of this Success Criterion</h5>
      <p>The intent of this Success Criterion is to ensure that content can be operated using gestures on a touch screen with platform assistive technology.</p>
<p>Generally, assistive technology such as a screen reader on a touch screen device will change the gestures that are used to interact with content when it is turned on.<p>
<p>For example, on both iOS and Android platforms, when the platform's screen reader (VoiceOver and TalkBack, respectively) is enabled, users will move their focus to the previous/next element using single swipe left/right gestures; using "touch to explore" functionality, a single tap on the touch screen will set focus to the element at that particular location on the screen; a double tap will activate the element.</p>
<p>While content may provide its own gesture-based controls, all functions available by touch when the platform assistive technology is not turned on must be still available when the platform assistive technology is turned on.</p>
      <p>Be famililar with your platform's system controls and standards for assistive technology. Use the system controls supported by the platform first and don't overwrite the standard gestures of the platform. Don't use a common gesture for a purpose that is not common. </p>
      <h5>Specific Benefits of Success Criterion 2.5.1</h5>
      <ul>
        <li>People who are blind who rely on the use of a screen reader while interacting with the touch screen</li>    
        <li>People with low vision who may also need speech turned on while interacting  	with the touch screen</li>
      </ul>
   <h5>Examples of Success Criterion 2.5.1</h5>
   	  <ul>
         <li>If a developer assigns a double tap as a custom gesture, as the only way to complete an action, a user who is blind using VoiceOver will not have access to that action because VoiceOver reserves the double tap to activate an item.</li>
         <li>If a developer assigns a swipe right as the only way to open a menu, the VoiceOver user will not be able to do that action, because VoiceOver takes over the right swipe as a way to move from element to element. To avoid this problem, the developer could ensure there is a mobile menu button that works with touch as another way to bring up the menu.</li>

<p>Swipe gestures are useful for displaying dynamic content. Giving focus to dynamic content via a swipe gesture also needs a gesture or method to move focus back to  prior content &mdash; either by swiping to return or by informing the user of the method needed to return. These methods must work with assistive technology. Explore by touch is not a valid solution, because the user can then miss content without knowing it was missed. This success criterion is similar to WCAG 2.1.2 No Keyboard Trap, however, it expands to all sequential navigation methods and compensates for touch specific failure criteria.  Relying on touch-to-explore features of mobile ATs to escape such a trap is still a failure under this criteria, because the next sequential item may be offscreen, an explore by touch gesture may cause users to get lost on the page, or the user may be relying on other means of sequential navigation such as a keyboard or switch control.</p>

  <p>People with various disabilities can inadvertently initiate touch or mouse events with unwanted results. Up-Event activation refers to the activation of a component when the trigger stimulus is released. For example, for touchscreen interaction the event would be triggered when a finger is lifted from the touchscreen at the end of a tap.There is a distinction between when someone touches a screen and when they remove their finger. On a mouse there is a difference between mouse down (initiating a click) and mouse up (releasing the finger). Authors can reduce the problem of users inadvertently triggering an action, by making activation on the up-event. This gives users the opportunity to move their finger (or mouse/pointer), away from the wrong target once they hit it. If touch down activation is necessary, there are several options:</p>
  <ul>
    <li> A confirmation alert allows the user to change their mind </li>
    <li> An undo button or other mechanism allows the user to reverse the action. </li>
    <li> A setting in preferences allows the user to choose whether activation happens on the down or up event. </li>
  </ul>
  <p>Generic platform activation/click events generally trigger on up and when they do, they are also allowed. For example, in the case of mouse interactions, the "click" event in JavaScript triggers on release of the primary mouse button, and is an example of an implicit up-event. An exception would be an activity that would be invalid if activation waited for the up-event. Examples of this could include a piano program or a program for shooting skeets where waiting for the "up" event would invalidate the activation. Long press activation and 3D touch can be used as long as one of the above listed alternatives is present, and there is another conforming way to provide the action performed by the control.</p>
  <p>Anywhere where we say &quot;touch and pointer&quot; we recognized that touch is included in the definition of pointer, but we include touch for clarity and ease of reading. </p>
  <p>On different platforms the "up-event" may be called different things, such as "touchend", &quot;onclick&quot; or "mouseup" etc..</p>
  <h5 class="benefit">Specific Benefits of Success Criterion 2.5.3</h5>
  <ul>
    <li>Makes it easier for all users to recover from hitting the wrong target.</li>
    <li>Helps people with visual disabilities, cognitive limitations, and   motor impairments by reducing the chance that a control will be   accidentally activated or action will occur unexpectedly.</li>
    <li>Individuals who are unable to detect changes of context are less likely to become disoriented while navigating a site</li>
  </ul>
  <h5 class="examples">Examples of Success Criterion 2.5.3</h5>
  <ul>
    <li>Interface elements that require a single tap or a long press as   input will only trigger the corresponding event when the finger is   lifted inside that element. </li>
    <li>The user interface control performs an action when the user lifts   the finger away from the control rather than when the user first touches   the control.</li>
    <li>A phone dialing application has number keys that are activated on   touch down. A user can undo an unwanted number by hitting the backspace   button to delete a mistaken digit. </li>

<li>20px by 20px for pointer inputs with fine pointing accuracy (such as a mouse, trackpad or stylus)</li>
</ul>
  where px is a CSS <a href="#def-pixel">pixel</a>. </h4>
<p>Note: In situations where multiple input mechanisms with both coarse and fine pointing accuracy are present, and where no mechanisms are present to determine the user's current input (either manual - e.g. providing the user with an explicit toggle to switch to a "touch-optimized" interface - or automatic - e.g. an application switching dynamically based on the type of input the user is currently using), targets must follow the larger minimum dimensions for coarse pointer inputs.</p>
<p>Note: This success criterion applies when platform assistive technology (e.g. magnification) is not turned on.</p>
<p>Editor's Note: We are researching the 20px value for mouse/pointer and 44px for touch. We are seeking research on this and outside input. We also have to define the difference between a touch event and a mouse event, particularly in html and responsive environments.</p>
<p>Editor's Note: this criterion borrows the distinction of "coarse" and "fine" pointing devices from <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/mediaqueries-4/#descdef-media-pointer">Media Queries Level 4 - Pointing Device Quality: the pointer feature</a></p>

    Intent of this Success Criterion</h5>
  <p>The intent of this success criterion is to help users who may have trouble activating a small target because of hand tremors, limited dexterity or other reasons. If the target is too small, it may be difficult to aim at the target. Mice and similar pointing devices can be hard to use for these users, and a larger target will help them greatly in having positive outcomes on the web page.</p>
  <p>Touch is particularly problematic as it is an input mechanism with coarse precision. Users lack the same level of fine control as on inputs such as a mouse or stylus. A finger is larger than a mouse pointer, and generally obstructs the user's view of the precise location on the screen that is being touched/activated.</p>p>
  <p>The issue can be further complicated on for responsive/mobile which need to accommodate different types of fine and coarse inputs (e.g. a site that can be accessed both on a traditional desktop/laptop with a mouse, as well as on a tablet or mobile phone with a touch screen).</p>
  <p>While this criterion defines a minimum target size, even large sizes are recommended to reduce the possibility of unintentional actions. This is particularly relevant if any of the following are true:</p>
  <ul>
  <li>the control is used frequently;</li>
  <li>the result of the interaction cannot be easily undone;</li>
  <li>the control is positioned where it will be difficult to reach, or is near the edge of the screen;</li>
  <li>the control is part of a sequential task.</li>

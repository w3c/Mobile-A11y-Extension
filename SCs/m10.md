# SC Shortname

Device sensors

# SC Text

All functionality can be operated without requiring specific device sensor information.

Note 1: device sensors information includes tilt, orientation, proximity.

# What Principle and Guideline the SC falls within.

Principle 2, *new* Guideline "Additional sensor inputs"

# Description

Devices may have additional sensors that act as inputs - e.g. tilt/orientation sensors on a mobile/tablet, allowing the user to control something by simply changing the orientation of the device in space. Not all devices have these sensors, OR the device may have the sensors but the user may be unable to operate these sensors (at all, or precisely enough).

# Benefits

TODO: Clear information about how the proposal will benefit users, along with justification and evidence of the benefits (this may be a link to a different resource).

# Testability

TODO: Description of how this SC can be tested. This may include manual, automated, or semi-automated mechanisms.

# Techniques

Functionality/content must not solely rely on device inputs (e.g. an alternative which does not require the user to manipulate their device/use these device inputs must be available)

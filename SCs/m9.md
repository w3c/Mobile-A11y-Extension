# SC Shortname

Pointer inputs with additional sensors

# SC Text

All pointer functionality can be operated using screen coordinate information, without requiring additional sensor information.

Note 1: Additional sensor information includes pressure (for instance on pressure-sensitive touch screens), tilt or twist (for instance on advanced pen/stylus digitizers).

# Suggestion for Priority Level (A/AA/AAA)

Level A

# Related Glossary additions or changes

Pointer inputs: input devices that can target a specific coordinate (or set of coordinates) on a screen, such as a mouse, pen, or touch contact. (modified slightly from https://w3c.github.io/pointerevents/#glossary)

# What Principle and Guideline the SC falls within.

Principle 2, *new* Guideline "Additional sensor inputs"

# Description

Some pointer input devices provide sensors to detect - beyond simple x/y screen coordinates - additional values such as twist, tilt, pressure. Not all users may have these advanced pointer input devices (e.g. users may have a touch screen, but not a pressure-sensitive touch screen), OR they may have the device, but may be unable to operate the advanced functionality (at all, or precisely enough).

[Editorial comment: this may be seen as a deepening/clarification of 2.5.1; also, 2.1.1/2.1.3 are of course also still valid, so beyond dropping down from "advanced" to "non-advanced" pointer, functionality must also be operable with just the keyboard]

# Benefits

TODO: Clear information about how the proposal will benefit users, along with justification and evidence of the benefits (this may be a link to a different resource).

# Testability

TODO: Description of how this SC can be tested. This may include manual, automated, or semi-automated mechanisms.

# Techniques

Functionality/content must not solely rely on advanced pointer input information (e.g. an alternative which does not require advanced sensors, but just plain x/y screen coordinate information only, must be available)

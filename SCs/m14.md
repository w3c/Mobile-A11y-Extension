# SC Shortname

Non-interference of Assistive Technology

# SC Text
Any mechanisms a user agent provides to circumvent the normal operation of the platform assistive technology should be avoided, unless required by the nature of the content.  When the content requires overriding the standard behavior of the platform AT, a mechanism for returning to standard behavior is available.

# Suggestion for Priority Level (A/AA/AAA)

# What Principle and Guideline the SC falls within.

Principle 4, Guideline 4.1 - Compatible (Or perhaps this is really a 4.2)

# Description

The intent of this success criterion is to prevent content from forcing the platform AT to misbehave.  Touch ATs rely on the users ability to interact with a series of gestures to control focus, interract, and speak descriptions of on screen elements.  If the content overrides these gestures, users dependant upon these mechanisms for content interaction will be unable to perform basic functions.  

A common scenario is passing touch through directly to the content, bypassing the AT entirely.  While this may be required for certain types of content, if such content covers significant area of the screen, it could completely block the use of the device by touch AT users, as performing swipe gestures on small patches of screen can be difficult.  

Users should be warned before entering any section of content that changes the way the platform AT intercepts touch gestures.

# Benefits

* Users who use a mobile device where touch screen is the primary mode of interaction
* Users with visual impairments who depend on spoken feedback

# Testability

1. Locate all major content sections, and ensure AT gesture navigation works as expected for all sections.
2. Locate any items that bypass AT gesture navigation.
3. Ensure that either the control that loaded this content warned of its presence OR that the content has a preview mode that does not bypass gesture navigation.

# Techniques

Content Preview with Available Mechanism: Load the content first, without gesture overrides/AT Bypassing mechanisms, and confirm that the user wants gestures overridden.  EX: A confirmation dialogue before asking for a signature, confirmation dialogue re-appears each time focus leaves the signature panel.

Content Warning: An element that will load a control that bypasses the AT warns the user. EX: A warning on a control that loads a "paint" window.

Failure: A "paint" drawing screen with no heading, no warning, and no preview.  Content fills up screen, making ANY gesture based navigation difficult, trapping the user on that screen, unless they have a device with a hardware back button.
